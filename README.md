# HTLC , Taproot
This repository contains codes for implementing HTLC, atomic swap, Taproot, and MuSig. Further, useful documentation for reference will be added.


For broadcasting transactions, we utilized the [Blockstream API](https://blockstream.info). You can find its codes in the network file.

It should be noted that we have directly added the [Taproot Workshop](https://github.com/bitcoinops/taproot-workshop)'s codes to our repository and used them without making any modifications to their code.
